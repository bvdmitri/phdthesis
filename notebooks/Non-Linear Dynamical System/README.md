# Large-Scale Non-linear Dynamical System

This folder contains experiments for the double pendulum dynamics from the experimental evaluation section of the thesis.

There are two types of experiments:
- Dry run & plots: small notebooks that ensure that the model runs, no benchmarks are performed there. Used as a simple check.
- Benchmarks: proper benchmarks across different methods. Use same data and random seeds.
