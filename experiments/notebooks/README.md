# Experiments

This folder contains sub-folders for each experiment:

- **Large-Scale Linear Dynamical System** - a simple linear dynamical system with known state-transition matrix.
- **Large-Scale Non-linear Dynamical System** - a more complex non-linear and chaotic dynamical system (double pendulum) with discretized state-transition differential equations.
- **Continual Hierarchical Gaussian Filter** - an example of continual inference for infinite data streams on a hierarchical gaussian filter model.
