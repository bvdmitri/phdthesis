	abstract = {Purpose. To assess the daily life consequences of hearing loss in older adults and to explore the influences of hearing loss, subjective assessment of health and general life satisfaction, gender, age and marital status.Method. Eighty-four participants, each older than 65 years, were consecutively recruited from a hospital waiting list for outpatient hearing aid fitting. All participants were assessed by pure-tone audiometry. Daily life consequences of hearing loss were measured using the Hearing Disability and Handicap Scale, which assesses perceived activity limitation and participation restriction. Another questionnaire was used to measure self-assessed health and life satisfaction.Results. Adjusted linear regression analysis showed that activity limitation was significantly associated with increased hearing loss (p == 0.028) and decreased health (p == 0.009), and participation restriction with lower estimated life satisfaction (p ≤ 0.001). Gender, age and marital status were not determinant factors for perceived activity limitation or participation restriction.Conclusions. Daily life consequences of hearing loss, health conditions and general life satisfaction are closely related. These findings indicate that health factors and psychosocial aspects should be emphasised as a natural part of audiological rehabilitation.},

	abstract = {The extreme acoustic variability of speech is well established, which makes the proficiency of human speech perception all the more impressive. Speech perception, like perception in any modality, is relative to context, and this provides a means to normalize the acoustic variability in the speech signal. Acoustic context effects in speech perception have been widely documented, but a clear understanding of how these effects relate to each other across stimuli, timescales, and acoustic domains is lacking. Here we review the influences that spectral context, temporal context, and spectrotemporal context have on speech perception. Studies are organized in terms of whether the context precedes the target (forward effects) or follows it (backward effects), and whether the context is adjacent to the target (proximal) or temporally removed from it (distal). Special cases where proximal and distal contexts have competing influences on perception are also considered. Across studies, a common theme emerges: acoustic differences between contexts and targets are perceptually magnified, producing contrast effects that facilitate perception of target sounds and words. This indicates enhanced sensitivity to changes in the acoustic environment, which maximizes the amount of potential information that can be transmitted to the perceiver.

The amount, distribution, and time course of free radical formation have been defined, including a clinically significant late formation 7–10days following noise exposure, and one mechanism underlying noise-induced reduction in cochlear blood flow has finally been identified. These new insights have led to the formulation of new hypotheses regarding the molecular mechanisms of NIHL; and, from these, we have identified interventions that prevent NIHL, even with treatment onset delayed up to 3days post-noise. It is essential to now assess the additive effects of agents intervening at different points in the cell death pathway to optimize treatment efficacy. Finding safe and effective interventions that attenuate NIHL will provide a compelling scientific rationale to justify human trials to eliminate this single major cause of acquired hearing loss.},

These monogenic forms of hearing loss can be syndromic (characterized by hearing loss in combination with other abnormalities) or nonsyndromic (with only hearing loss).

	abstract = {Depression is a multifaceted illness with large interindividual variability in clinical response to treatment. In the era of digital medicine and precision therapeutics, new personalized treatment approaches are warranted for depression. Here, we use a combination of longitudinal ecological momentary assessments of depression, neurocognitive sampling synchronized with electroencephalography, and lifestyle data from wearables to generate individualized predictions of depressed mood over a 1-month time period. This study, thus, develops a systematic pipeline for N-of-1 personalized modeling of depression using multiple modalities of data. In the models, we integrate seven types of supervised machine learning (ML) approaches for each individual, including ensemble learning and regression-based methods. All models were verified using fourfold nested cross-validation. The best-fit as benchmarked by the lowest mean absolute percentage error, was obtained by a different type of ML model for each individual, demonstrating that there is no one-size-fits-all strategy. The voting regressor, which is a composite strategy across ML models, was best performing on-average across subjects. However, the individually selected best-fit models still showed significantly less error than the voting regressor performance across subjects. For each individual’s best-fit personalized model, we further extracted top-feature predictors using Shapley statistics. Shapley values revealed distinct feature determinants of depression over time for each person ranging from co-morbid anxiety, to physical exercise, diet, momentary stress and breathing performance, sleep times, and neurocognition. In future, these personalized features can serve as targets for a personalized ML-guided, multimodal treatment strategy for depression.},

Opportunities to apply ML occur in all stages of drug discovery. Examples include target validation, identification of prognostic biomarkers and analysis of digital pathology data in clinical trials. Applications have ranged in context and methodology, with some approaches yielding accurate predictions and insights. The challenges of applying ML lie primarily with the lack of interpretability and repeatability of ML-generated results, which may limit their application. In all areas, systematic and comprehensive high-dimensional data still need to be generated. With ongoing efforts to tackle these issues, as well as increasing awareness of the factors needed to validate ML approaches, the application of ML can promote data-driven decision making and has the potential to speed up the process and reduce failure rates in drug discovery and development.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Along with the rapid expansion of digital music formats, managing and searching for songs has become significant. Though music information retrieval (MIR) techniques have been made successfully in last ten years, the development of music recommender systems is still at a very early stage. Therefore, this paper surveys a general framework and state-of-art approaches in recommending music. Two popular algorithms: collaborative filtering (CF) and content-based model (CBM), have been found to perform well. Due to the relatively poor experience in finding songs in long tail and the powerful emotional meanings in music, two user-centric approaches: context-based model and emotion-based model, have been paid increasing attention. In this paper, three key components in music recommender- user modelling, item profiling, and match algorithms are discussed. Six recommendation models and four potential issues towards user experience, are explained. However, subjective music recommendation system has not been fully investigated. To this end, we propose a motivation-based model using the empirical studies of human behaviour, sports education, music psychology.},

An exciting and relatively recent development is the uptake of machine learning in the natural sciences, where the major goal is to obtain novel scientific insights and discoveries from observational or simulated data. A prerequisite for obtaining a scientific outcome is domain knowledge, which is needed to gain explainability, but also to enhance scientific consistency. In this article, we review explainable machine learning in view of applications in the natural sciences and discuss three core elements that we identified as relevant in this context: transparency, interpretability, and explainability. With respect to these core elements, we provide a survey of recent scientific works that incorporate machine learning and the way that explainable machine learning is used in combination with domain knowledge from the application areas.},

In the past, possible transit-like events identified by the WASP pipeline have been vetted by human inspection to eliminate false alarms and obvious false positives. The goal of this paper is to assess the effectiveness of machine learning as a fast, automated, and reliable means of performing the same functions on ground-based wide-field transit-survey data without human intervention. To this end, we have created training and test data sets made up of stellar light curves showing a variety of signal types including planetary transits, eclipsing binaries, variable stars, and non-periodic signals. We use a combination of machine-learning methods including Random Forest Classifiers (RFCs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to distinguish between the different types of signals. The final algorithms correctly identify planets in the test data ∼90 per cent of the time, although each method on its own has a significant fraction of false positives. We find that in practice, a combination of different methods offers the best approach to identifying the most promising exoplanet transit candidates in data from WASP, and by extension similar transit surveys.},

Since the 1960s, mathematicians have used computers to assist in the discovery of patterns and formulation of conjectures1, most famously in the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture2, a Millennium Prize Problem3. Here we provide examples of new fundamental results in pure mathematics that have been discovered with the assistance of machine learning—demonstrating a method by which machine learning can aid mathematicians in discovering new conjectures and theorems. We propose a process of using machine learning to discover potential patterns and relations between mathematical objects, understanding them with attribution techniques and using these observations to guide intuition and propose conjectures. We outline this machine-learning-guided framework and demonstrate its successful application to current research questions in distinct areas of pure mathematics, in each case showing how it led to meaningful mathematical contributions on important open problems: a new connection between the algebraic and geometric structure of knots, and a candidate algorithm predicted by the combinatorial invariance conjecture for symmetric groups4. Our work may serve as a model for collaboration between the fields of mathematics and artificial intelligence (AI) that can achieve surprising results by leveraging the respective strengths of mathematicians and machine learning.},

In this article, we attempt to strengthen the links between the two research communities by providing a survey of work in reinforcement learning for behavior generation in robots. We highlight both key challenges in robot reinforcement learning as well as notable successes. We discuss how contributions tamed the complexity of the domain and study the role of algorithms, representations, and prior knowledge in achieving these successes. As a result, a particular focus of our chapter lies on the choice between model-based and model-free as well as between value function-based and policy search methods. By analyzing a simple problem in some detail we demonstrate how reinforcement learning approaches may be profitably applied, and we note throughout open questions and the tremendous potential for future research.},

	abstract = {The paper reports the appraisal and analysis of impulsive noise emissions and associated measurement uncertainty for various firecrackers used commonly in Indian scenarios and indigenously made green crackers developed to reduce air emissions. The study is the first study on firecrackers noise in India on evaluation, analysis, and measurement uncertainty in noise emissions of green firecrackers that have now replaced the commercial crackers as per the recent judgment of the Supreme Court of India. The study analyzes the impact of fireworks noise on ambient noise scenarios and presents a perspective view of the legal noise regulations for the green crackers. The frequency-domain analysis, mathematical model correlating the impulsive noise with other time-averaged noise indicators and damage risk criteria, and noise-induced hearing loss due to cracker’s noise are analyzed. Finally, the study recommends some technical aspects on the legal noise regulations in India for firecrackers noise that shall be crucial for reducing the environmental noise pollution and associated health hazards.
The overall genetic profile for noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) remains elusive. Herein we proposed a novel machine learning (ML) based strategy to evaluate individual susceptibility to NIHL and identify the underlying genetic risk variants based on a subsample of participants with extreme phenotypes.
Five features (age, sex, cumulative noise exposure [CNE], smoking, and alcohol drinking status) of 5,539 shipbuilding workers from large cross-sectional surveys were included in four ML classification models to predict their hearing levels. The area under the curve (AUC) and prediction accuracy were exploited to evaluate the performance of the models. Based on the prediction error of the ML models, the NIHL-susceptible group (n=150) and NIHL-resistant group (n=150) with a paradoxical relationship between hearing levels and features were separately screened, to identify the underlying variants associated with NIHL risk using whole-exome sequencing (WES). Subsequently, candidate risk variants were validated in an additional replication cohort (n=2108), followed by a meta-analysis.
With 10-fold cross-validation, the performances of the four ML models were robust and similar, with average AUCs and accuracies ranging from 0.783 to 0.798 and 73.7\% to 73.8\%, respectively. The phenotypes of the NIHL-susceptible and NIHL-resistant groups were significantly different (all p{\textless}0.001). After WES analysis and filtering, 12 risk variants contributing to NIHL susceptibility were identified and replicated. The meta-analyses showed that the A allele of CDH23 rs41281334 (odds ratio [OR]=1.506, 95\% confidence interval [CI]=1.106-2.051) and the C allele of WHRN rs12339210 (OR=3.06, 95\% CI=1.398-6.700) were significantly associated with increased risk of NIHL after adjustment for confounding factors.
This study revealed two genetic variants in CDH23 rs41281334 and WHRN rs12339210 that associated with NIHL risk, based on a promising approach for evaluating individual susceptibility using ML models.
Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is a serious problem in occupational environments; however, there is little information about hearing loss due to combined exposure to noise and vibration. This study aimed to investigate the combined effects of exposure to noise and whole-body vibration (WBV) on hearing responses under simulated heavy equipment driving conditions. A repeated measures study was designed to evaluate the changes in distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) amplitudes as hearing responses to 40 min of noise and/or WBV exposure. Thirty healthy males with an average age of 30.17 (±3.94) years, exposed to noise level of 85 dB(A) and two WBV levels (0.87 and 1.3 m/s2) in six experimental scenarios. The findings revealed that there was a significant change in DPOAE amplitudes after single noise exposure and combined noise and WBV exposure (p {\textless} 0.05); however, there was no significant difference in WBV exposure alone (p {\textgreater} 0.05). The changes in DPOAE amplitudes were greater in combined exposure to noise and WBV (1.3 m/s2) in all sessions. The statistical analysis showed the effect sizes of the combined exposure to noise and WBV were more than the sum of the exposure to each one alone. It can be concluded that some synergic effects can occur in DPOAE amplitudes in the combined noise and WBV exposure under heavy equipment driving conditions. These findings can help the occupational health experts adapt the existing physical agents' exposure limits to the realistic conditions of the occupational settings.},

the explicit consideration of the state of the environment, the knowledge 
and experiences of the designer, and the interactions between the designer

situatedness is the notion of design situation and constructive memory. A 
design situation models a particular state of interaction between a design 
agent and the environment at a particular point in time. Memory 
construction occurs whenever a design agent uses past experiences and 
knowledge within the current design environment in a situated manner. This 
paper is concerned with the development of an agent-based computational 
design tool that takes into consideration the notion of situatedness in 
designing. A key element of this tool is a constructive memory system that 
supports the dynamic nature of designing. Memories of past experiences are 
constructed as required by the current situation, and past experiences are 
refined for future utility according to the current interactions between 
the agent and the environment. This latter case of knowledge improvement 
is illustrated through a series of experiments that demonstrates the 
effect of grounding on the operating modes and responses of a constructive 
memory system.},

	abstract = {In the rationalistic perspective, the human expert is seen as a data processing system having properties similar to computers. As a consequence, the design of man machine interfaces, workplaces, and organizational procedures has been mainly driven by technological advances, focusing on replacing humans rather than supporting their actual needs. A more appropriate explanation of human cognition is based on the notion of situatedness: human cognition is considered to be emergent from the interaction of the human with the environment, i.e., the current situation the human is involved in. More generally, the system environment coupling is a prerequisite of cognition and cannot be abstracted away. We summarize the rationalistic perspective, its pitfalls, and its (undesirable) influences on design. As an alternative, we propose "situated design", a design methodology capitalizing on the notion of the human as a situated agent. We demonstrate how "situated design" can be applied to workplace design and computer system design, and we outline a situated perspective on man machine interface design supporting humans in coping with the so called "information overload" phenomenon.},

	title = {Texture representation using autoregressive models},
	doi = {10.1109/ACTEA.2009.5227909},
	abstract = {Texture is a fundamental characteristic in many natural images that plays an important role in human visual perception and in turn provides information for image understanding and scene interpretation. The textured image can be modeled to describe, analyze and synthesize the texture. The model parameters capture the essential perceived qualities of texture. One of the important characteristics of texture data is the statistical dependence of the gray level at a lattice point on those of its neighbors. The spatial-interaction models characterize this statistical dependency by representing the intensity of a pixel, as a 2-D linear combination of the intensity of its neighbors and an additive noise. One way of specifying this interaction is simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) models. This is one of the most traditional methods used for modeling in the area of image processing. This paper presents the work done by the authors on parameter estimation and synthesis of textured images using simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) modeling. Different programs are developed in MATLAB to implement the parameter estimation and synthesis and are tested for their performance. The scope of this work includes the use of causal and noncausal methods for modeling and synthesizing natural textures. Simultaneous or spatial autoregressive models with causal and noncausal neighborhoods are used for parameter estimation and texture pattern generation. Parameter estimation is done by two different methods: the least square error (LSE) and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). LSE method is preferred for causal models. MLE method is used for noncausal autoregressive models and it uses iterative algorithm. The synthesis procedure is based on generating a two dimensional autoregressive random field driven by a two dimensional zero mean white noise field with unit variance. Two different algorithms are used for synthesis of causal and noncausal AR models. Different image textures are synthesized using a given set of neighborhoods and parameters. Different patterns of synthetic images can be generated using various sets of parameters. A number of images from Brodatz album are tested for parameter estimation and synthesis. The synthesized image retains the pattern in the original image like vertical or horizontal streaks. An interactive graphical user interface (GUI) is developed using MATLAB that allows user to select one image from Brodatz album. The user can choose between causal or noncausal neighborhood and select number of elements in the neighborhood or choose any one set of neighborhood from different sets stored, and find out SAR model parameters by one of the methods of parameter estimation. The user can synthesize the image using these parameters. Both original and synthesized image are displayed side by side on the screen and the user can easily compare the two images. Thus the GUI offers an interactive platform for implementation of parameter estimation using different neighborhoods for the images from Brodatz album and synthesis of the image from these estimated parameters.},

	doi = {10.1097/AUD.0b013e31828d269a},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Commercial trainable hearing aids (HA) (i.e., devices that for a period are adjusted by the user in different acoustic environments and that subsequently with changing environments automatically adapt to the user's preferred settings), are readily available; however, little information exists about the efficacy of training a HA. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy and reliability of training a HA in everyday environments.
DESIGN: The participants were 26 hearing-impaired volunteers with a median age of 79 years and an average pure-tone average of 53 dB HL. Test devices were commercial, multimemory, prototype devices that enabled training of the compression characteristics in four frequency bands and in six sound classes. Participants wore the National Acoustic Laboratories nonlinear fitting procedure version 2 prescription for 3 weeks and trained the devices from the prescribed response for 3 weeks, before comparing their trained response with the prescription for 2 weeks. The devices were reset to the prescription, and 19 participants repeated the training and comparison trials. During the comparison trial, participants made daily diary ratings of their satisfaction with the programs, and a structured interview was completed at the end of the comparison trial.
RESULTS: The participants displayed different needs for changing the prescription, with more daily adjustments leading to training across more sound classes. Unreliable observations were obtained from 8 participants after each of the test and retest comparison trials. Of the 10 participants who made sufficient changes to the prescription during the first trial, 80\% preferred their trained response. The 8 "low trainers" reported no preference, and also reported lower overall satisfaction with the device. Fewer adjustments were made during the repeat trial, resulting in less training. Significant correlations between trained variations were seen for 63\% of 19 participants. Of the 10 participants who provided valid data after both comparison trials, those who trained the device consistently generally showed consistent preferences, and vice versa.
CONCLUSIONS: For those who wanted a change to the prescription, training was mostly effective. Limited data on reliability showed reasonable consistency in training outcomes and preferences. Findings, in particular on reliability, should be verified in larger populations. A guideline on how to clinically manage training with clients is presented.},

	abstract = {To date, cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the first leading cause of global death. The Electrocardiogram (ECG) is the most widely adopted clinical tool that measures and records the electrical activity of the heart from the body surface. The mainstream resting ECG machines for CVD diagnosis and supervision can be ineffective in detecting abnormal transient heart activities, which may not occur during an individual's hospital visit. Common Holter-based portable solutions offer 24-hour ECG recording, containing hundreds of thousands of heart beats that not only are tedious and time-consuming to analyze manually but also miss the capability to provide any real-time feedback. In this study, we seek to establish a cell phone-based personalized medicine technology for CVD, capable of performing continuous monitoring and recording of ECG in real time, generating individualized cardiac health summary report in layman's language, automatically detecting abnormal CVD conditions and classifying them at any place and anytime. Specifically, we propose to develop an artificial neural network (ANN)-based machine learning technique, combining both individualized medical information and clinical ECG database data, to train the cell phone to learn to adapt to its user's physiological conditions to achieve better ECG feature extraction and more accurate CVD classification results.},

	abstract = {Personalized, precision, P4, or stratified medicine is understood as a medical approach in which patients are stratified based on their disease subtype, risk, prognosis, or treatment response using specialized diagnostic tests. The key idea is to base medical decisions on individual patient characteristics, including molecular and behavioral biomarkers, rather than on population averages. Personalized medicine is deeply connected to and dependent on data science, specifically machine learning (often named Artificial Intelligence in the mainstream media). While during recent years there has been a lot of enthusiasm about the potential of ‘big data’ and machine learning-based solutions, there exist only few examples that impact current clinical practice. The lack of impact on clinical practice can largely be attributed to insufficient performance of predictive models, difficulties to interpret complex model predictions, and lack of validation via prospective clinical trials that demonstrate a clear benefit compared to the standard of care. In this paper, we review the potential of state-of-the-art data science approaches for personalized medicine, discuss open challenges, and highlight directions that may help to overcome them in the future.},

Spectrogram reading and algorithms for sound reconstruction from magnitude spectrograms are striking illustrations of this idea, and one might be tempted to think that, whatever the phase combined with a given magnitude, the worse that could happen when resynthesizing a signal through inverse STFT is to obtain a noisy version of the sound that the intuition hints at. We show in this paper that it is not the case: while results meeting the intuition can indeed be obtained by minimizing what we call the “inconsistency” of a spectrogram, we investigate in this paper what happens when inconsistency is maximized instead of minimized, and explain how the same magnitude spectrogram can lead, depending on the phase it is combined with, to extremely diverse resynthesized sounds, some of them very far from what one would expect.},
