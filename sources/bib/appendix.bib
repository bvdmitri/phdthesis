  abstract = {Some simple heuristic properties of conditional independence are
              shown to form a conceptual framework for much of the theory of
              statistical inference. This framework is illustrated by an
              examination of the role of conditional independence in several
              diverse areas of the field of statistics. Topics covered include
              sufficiency and ancillarity, parameter identification, causal
              inference, prediction sufficiency, data selection mechanisms,
              invariant statistical models and a subjectivist approach to
              model-building.},
