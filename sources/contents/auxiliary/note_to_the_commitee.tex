    \small
    Dear committee member,\\
    Thank you for your time and anticipated feedback on the dissertation. A significant portion of this work involved implementing the research concepts and the proposed architecture in an open-source toolbox named RxInfer. The implementation is accessible on GitHub at this link: \url{https://github.com/biaslab/RxInfer.jl}. 
    
    The toolbox has been showcased at various conferences, and you can gain an overview of the research through pre-recorded videos available at the following links:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A high-level introduction to \textbf{RxInfer} is available at \url{https://youtu.be/qXrvDVm_fnE?si=6I6DUp7XKI5xNKvk};
        \item A video about the underlying reactive message passing inference engine \textbf{ReactiveMP} is available at \url{https://youtu.be/twhTsKsXa_8?si=QN3xbST17msRmgin};
        \item A video about the model and constraints specification languages \textbf{GraphPPL} is available at \url{https://youtu.be/N3zs6Ya57v4?si=rHRUj2jyQ-CdcvDL};
        \item A video about the reactive programming library \textbf{Rocket} developed for the purposes of the research is available at \url{https://youtu.be/5UVwzzWeCm8?si=V6V9r4WRvpcx5Rfq}.
    \end{itemize}

    Additional community-made videos on YouTube include:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Intro to RxInfer.jl | Automatic Bayesian Inference on Factor Graph with Message Passing \url{https://youtu.be/_vVHWzK9NEI?si=D5z04kwncA5fZtnT};
        \item Real-time, Streaming Bayesian Analysis using RxInfer.jl \url{https://youtu.be/mJkMCwugI1A?si=kIgyVBxdS2GRRPAw};
        \item Bayesian Variational Inference (VI) using RxInfer.jl \url{https://youtu.be/qnj0PKc734g?si=8AT0HN7_bfG9BYZn}.
    \end{itemize}
    
    Significant effort has also been dedicated to documenting the implementation, which is a crucial aspect of the work. The following links provide comprehensive documentation on RxInfer and its sub-packages:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \url{https://biaslab.github.io/RxInfer.jl/stable/}
        \item \url{https://biaslab.github.io/ReactiveMP.jl/stable/}
        \item \url{https://biaslab.github.io/GraphPPL.jl/stable/}
        \item \url{https://biaslab.github.io/Rocket.jl/stable/}
    \end{itemize}

    I am looking forward to your feedback!\\
    Best regards,\\
    Dmitry\\
