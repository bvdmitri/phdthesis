\section{Non-linear dynamical system}\label{chapter-05:section:nonlinear-dynamical-system}

In this section, we delve into a more complex model and inference setting by considering a \ac{nlds}.
The real world is often "nonlinear" and many physical processes are better described by
nonlinear differential equations \citep{roubicek_nonlinear_2013}.
Inference in \acp{nlds} finds extensive applications in various industries beyond
signal processing \citep{Revach_kalmannet_2022}, including fields such as robotics
\citep{cernousko_control_2008}, astronomy \citep{Contopoulos_astronomy_nlds}, biology
\citep{Janson_bilogy_nlds}, economics \citep{hsieh_chaos_1991}, climate modeling
\citep{mukhin_principal_2015}, and many many more (\hyperlink{experiments:utility}{\emph{Utility}}).
As in the previous example, an \ac{nlds} is a state-space model that evolves over time
$t$, where the subsequent state of the system depends solely on the preceding state.
However, unlike the previous example, the relationship between subsequent states in this model is
nonlinear, introducing additional challenges in the inference process.

In its general form, an \ac{nlds} model can be expressed as follows
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:sim:nlds}
  \begin{split}
    s_t &= f(s_{t - 1}) + v_{t}, \\% ~~\sigma_{t} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \Sigma)\\ 
    y_t &= g(s_t) + w_{t}, % ~~\omega_{t} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \Omega)
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
where $s_t$ denotes the state of the system at time $t$, and $f$
represents an arbitrary nonlinear state-transition function.
The observation at time $t$ is denoted by $y_t$, and $g$ represents an arbitrary (potentially
also nonlinear) observational function.
The terms $v_{t}$ and $w_{t}$ represent process and measurement noise signals and are often assumed to be Gaussian distributed with zero mean and
covariance matrices $\Sigma$ and $\Omega$, respectively:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:sim:nlds-stochastic-gaussian}
    \begin{split}
        v_{t} &\sim \mathcal{N}(0, \Sigma) \\
        w_{t} &\sim \mathcal{N}(0, \Omega) \\
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
By expressing the model~\eqref{eq:sim:nlds} with the assumption~\eqref{eq:sim:nlds-stochastic-gaussian} 
in terms of probability densities, we obtain the model specification
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:sim:nlds_probabilities}
  \begin{aligned}
    p(s_t\vert s_{t-1}, \Sigma)
     & = \mathcal{N}(s_t \vert f(s_{t-1}), \Sigma) \\ p(y_t\vert s_{t}, \Omega) & = \mathcal{N}(y_t
       \vert g(s_{t}), \Omega)
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where the first equation, $p(s_t\vert
  s_{t-1}, \Sigma)$, denotes the conditional probability distribution of the state $s_t$ given the
previous state $s_{t-1}$ and the covariance matrix $\Sigma$.
Similarly, the second equation, $p(y_t\vert s_{t}, \Omega)$, represents the conditional probability
distribution of the observation $y_t$ given the current state $s_t$ and the covariance
matrix $\Omega$.

The complete probabilistic model can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:sim:nlds_model} p(\bm{y}, \bm{s}, \Sigma, \Omega) =
  \underbrace{p(\Sigma)p(\Omega)p(s_1)}_{\mathrm{prior}}\underbrace{\prod_{t = 1}^{T} p(y_t\vert
    s_t, \Omega)}_{\mathrm{likelihood}}\underbrace{\prod_{t = 2}^{T}p(s_t\vert s_{t - 1},
    \Sigma)}_{\mathrm{state~transitions}}
\end{equation}
where $p(\Sigma)$, $p(\Omega)$, and
$p(s_1)$ denote the priors for $\Sigma$, $\Omega$, and $s_1$, respectively.
Prior terms contribute to the overall prior probability of the model, incorporating prior
beliefs or knowledge about the covariance matrices and the initial state.
This formulation provides a comprehensive representation of the probabilistic model that
includes priors, likelihoods, and state transitions.
Figure~\eqref{fig:sim:lds_model_graph} provides a visual representation of the probabilistic
model~\eqref{eq:sim:lds_model} in the form of \ac{tffg}.
The \ac{tffg} visualizes the dependencies and flow of information within the model and illustrates
the interconnections between the different components of the \ac{nlds} model.

The probabilistic model~\eqref{eq:sim:nlds_model} is similar to the one discussed in
Section~\ref{chapter-05:section:linear-dynamical-system}, but with the notable difference that
both the transition and the observational functions are nonlinear.
The introduction of nonlinearities adds complexity to the inference procedure, as analytical
closed-form solutions for the exact Bayesian inference with arbitrary nonlinearities are generally not
available.
Therefore, we need to employ approximate inference techniques to estimate the posterior
distributions in this setting.

\subsection{Example of a nonlinear dynamical system}

As a particular simplistic example of an \ac{nlds} system, we choose the dynamics of a double
pendulum physical system.
The double pendulum system consists of two pendulums (rods) connected to each other.
Despite its simple appearance, the double pendulum exhibits complex and chaotic behavior,
making it an interesting case study \citep{levien_double_1993}.
Figure~\ref{fig:sim:double_pendulum_notation} provides an illustration of the double
pendulum system, depicting the rods and their movement restricted to two dimensions in the
vertical plane.
The dynamics of the double pendulum is described by a set of coupled ordinary differential
equations, which capture the relationship between the state of pendulums and their motion.
Due to its chaotic nature, the behavior of the double pendulum is highly sensitive to the
initial conditions, resulting in unpredictable and complex motion patterns.

% The motion equations of the double pendulum system can be discretized in time and solved
% numerically using methods such as the Runge-Kutta method
% \citep[Chapter~8]{hasselblatt_handbook_2002}.
Assuming that $s_t$ is the state of the system at time $t$, the evolution of the state of the double pendulum system can be
rewritten as \ac{nlds}~\eqref{eq:sim:nlds} (see Appendix~\ref{appendix:proofs:double_pendulum_dynamics}). 
Similar to the previous example in Section~\ref{chapter-05:section:linear-dynamical-system}, the number of latent states in the system increases linearly with the number of available observations.
The primary challenge lies in accurately estimating and tracking the evolution of the latent
states of the system given noisy measurements at specific points in time. 
More formally, we are interested in estimating the following Bayesian posteriors:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:sim:nlds-problem-statement}
    p(s_t\vert\hat{\bm{y}}_{1:T}) = \int p(\bm{y}, \bm{s}, \Sigma, \Omega)\prod_{i = 1}^{T}\delta(y_i - \hat{y}_i)\mathrm{d}\Sigma\mathrm{d}\Omega\mathrm{d}s_{\setminus t}\mathrm{d}\bm{y}~~\forall t \in 1:T.
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \resizebox{0.75\textwidth}{!}{\input{contents/05-experiments/figs/03-double-pendulum-notation.tex}}
  \caption{
    An illustration of the double pendulum system.
    The system consists of two rods with lengths $l_i$ and two bobs with masses $m_i$.
    The rods are connected to each other.
    The state of the system at time $t$ is fully described by the state vector $(\theta_1,
      \theta_2, \dot{\theta}_1, \dot{\theta}_2)_t$, where $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ represent the 
      relative angles and $\dot{\theta}_1$ and $\dot{\theta}_2$ represent the angular velocities,
    respectively.
    The vector $g$ represents the gravitational force.
  }
  \label{fig:sim:double_pendulum_notation}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Simulated measurements}

Several variants of the double pendulum system may be considered: the two rods may be of equal
or unequal lengths and masses, they may be simple pendulums or compound pendulums (also called
complex pendulums), and the motion may be in three dimensions or restricted to the vertical
plane.

In the experiments, we consider a specific variant of the double pendulum system.
The two rods are assumed to be identical simple pendulums of unit length $l_1 = l_2 = l = 1$.
The masses of the bobs are assumed to be different and are denoted as $m_1$ and $m_2$
respectively.
The motion of the system is restricted to two dimensions in the vertical plane.
The states of the system, denoted as $s_t$, are 4-dimensional vectors $(\theta_1, \theta_2,
  \dot{\theta}_1, \dot{\theta}_2)_t$, representing the relative angles and angular velocities.
We also assume that the time difference (elapsed time) between two observations is fixed and known.

To make the inference procedure more challenging, we assume that the observation function is
given by $g(s_t) = \mathrm{dot}(s_t, \left[ 0, 1, 0, 0 \right]) = \theta_2$, which means that only the second component of the state vector $s_t$ is directly observable.
The other components of the state vector cannot be observed directly.
Additionally, the variance $\Omega$ of the noise component $w_t$ in~\eqref{eq:sim:nlds}
is assumed to be unknown, and the covariance $\Sigma$ of the noise component $v_t$ is assumed to be
small.

Figure~\ref{fig:sim:pendulum_example_states} shows the evolution of the double pendulum system
over the first 250 time steps, together with the corresponding observations.
The simulation is carried out using the Runge-Kutta (RK4) method, with an initial state of $s_1
  = (1.2, 0.2, 0.0, 0.0)$.

\subsection{The probabilistic model and the inference specification}

Listing~\ref{lst:sim:double_pendulum_model_specification} provides an example of the specification of the 
probabilistic model for the double pendulum system with nonlinear
dynamics~\eqref{eq:sim:nlds_model} using the RxInfer
framework.
\begin{figure*}
  \begin{adjustbox}{minipage=\textwidth,margin=0pt \smallskipamount,center}

        },captionpos=b]{contents/05-experiments/code/03-double-pendulum-model.jl}
  \end{adjustbox}
\end{figure*}
As part of the inference specification, we also introduce extra factorization constraints for
the variational family of distributions $Q_{B}$ using the \jlinl{@constraints} macro, as shown
in Listing~\eqref{lst:sim:double_pendulum_constraints}. 

These constraints assume that the states $\bm{s}$ and the precision of the measurement noise
are jointly independent.
\begin{figure*}
  \begin{adjustbox}{minipage=\textwidth,margin=0pt \smallskipamount,center}
    \jlinputlisting[label={lst:sim:double_pendulum_constraints}, caption={
          Extra factorization constraints for the variational family of distributions $Q_{B}$ in the probabilistic model of the double pendulum dynamics, which is defined in Listing~\eqref{lst:sim:double_pendulum_model_specification}.
        },captionpos=b]{contents/05-experiments/code/03-double-pendulum-constraints.jl}
  \end{adjustbox}
\end{figure*}
We utilize the \jlinl{@meta} macro to define an approximate inference strategy for the factor
$f$ in the model, as obtaining an exact solution is not feasible.
For our approximation method, we employ the \jlinl{Linearization()} method, which is a
first-order Taylor series expansion approximation.
The method locally approximates the nonlinearity with a linear function and performs exact
inference on the approximated factor \citep[Section~5.2]{sarkka_bayesian_2013}.
The \jlinl{Linearization()} method is provided by the RxInfer framework.
Other approximation strategies are possible, for example, Unscented transform
\citep[Section~5.5]{sarkka_bayesian_2013} or the Conjugate-Computation variational inference 
\citep{khan_conjugate-computation_2017,akbayrak_probabilistic_2022}.

        },captionpos=b]{contents/05-experiments/code/03-double-pendulum-meta.jl}
  \end{adjustbox}
\end{figure*}
In order to execute the inference procedure we simply call the \jlinl{inference()} function,
see Listing~\eqref{lst:sim:double_pendulum_inference}.
Figure~\ref{fig:sim:pendulum_example_inference_states} presents an example of the inference
task, showing the inferred posterior distributions over the states along with their
respective uncertainties.
Implementing the model and inference specifications for this type of model requires
approximately 30 lines of code (\hyperlink{experiments:userfriendliness}{\emph{User-friendliness}}).

This section presents benchmark results for the inference task in the \ac{nlds} model for the double
pendulum system.
The main results are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sim:nlds_performance_comparison}, which compares
the performance of different inference methods.
The accuracy of the methods is evaluated using the metric~\eqref{eq:sim:average_mse}, and the
results are summarized in Table~\ref{table:sim:nlds_accuracy_comparison}.

Similarly to the previous example, the RxInfer framework demonstrates excellent performance and
scalability compared to alternative packages, both in model creation and inference execution.
However, in contrast to the previous example, we observe that the absolute inference execution
timings between scheduled message passing implemented in ForneyLab and reactive message
passing implemented in RxInfer are similar.
This is because the inference task in this example is more complex, and the additional
run-time costs for managing reactive streams are less noticeable.
However, it is worth noting that ForneyLab's model compilation times are high, and any change
in the model specification requires a full model recompilation.
However, while the reactive message passing architecture in RxInfer does not provide
significant performance advantages, it also does not incur considerable overhead in generating
the fixed global message passing schedule, which is required in ForneyLab.

We specifically focus on presenting benchmark results for a large number of observations using
the RxInfer framework, as executing the inference with the other compared methods would
require significantly longer computation times, which are not suitable for real-time
applications.
Despite the inherently challenging nature of inference tasks in \ac{nlds} models, the RxInfer
framework demonstrates impressive scalability and performance (\hyperlink{experiments:scalability}{\emph{Scalability}}).
In fact, RxInfer is capable of executing the inference task on a full model graph for
$100\,000$ observations in less than $25$ seconds, resulting in an average of less than $0.25$
milliseconds per observation, which is well suited for real-time applications in many
fields (\hyperlink{experiments:efficiency}{\emph{Run-time efficiency and speed}}).

Interestingly, the accuracy results, which are given in Table~\ref{table:sim:nlds_accuracy_comparison}, indicate
that \ac{nuts} performs better in estimating the posterior distributions compared to message
passing-based inference in terms of~\eqref{eq:sim:average_mse} (\hyperlink{experiments:accuracy}{\emph{Posterior accuracy}}).
This could be because both RxInfer and ForneyLab rely on the first-order Taylor approximation
for the state transition nonlinearity, which is a fast but not very accurate method of approximation.
On the other hand, the RxInfer framework provides a user-friendly approach to easily change
and modify approximation methods for different nodes, also allowing for flexibility in
selecting specific approximation methods for different parts of the model.
However, it is worth noting that the accuracy of \ac{nuts} does not improve with an increased
number of samples, suggesting challenges in performing inference for nonlinear models.
Additionally, \ac{nuts} exhibits poor scalability and, similar to the previous example, is not
suitable for real-time applications.

In the upcoming section, we will delve into an example of continuous inference tasks in a nonlinear hierarchical dynamical system.
The example involves a potentially infinite dynamic stream of data, further highlighting the
capabilities of RxInfer to handle continuous and evolving scenarios.
