# RxInfer experiments and comparisons

This respository contains experimental benchmarks across three packages: [RxInfer.jl](https://github.com/biaslab/RxInfer.jl), 
[ForneyLab.jl](https://github.com/biaslab/ForneyLab.jl) and [Turing.jl](https://github.com/TuringLang/Turing.jl).
The codebase uses the Julia programming language of version 1.9.0. 
To ensure reproducibility the experimanets have been prepared with the help of the 
[DrWatson.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDynamics/DrWatson.jl) package.
